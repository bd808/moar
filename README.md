Moar PHP Library
================

Moar is a smallish collection of PHP libraries and frameworks maintained by
Bryan Davis.

About
-----
I do a lot of PHP development at $DAYJOB. Over time I have designed quite
a few useful classes and small frameworks that work the way my brain wants
them to. When I'm working on sideprojects that happen to involve PHP I'm often
frustrated that I don't have access to these valuable building blocks.

Moar is slow attempt to recreate the truly valuable parts in a way that is
a decoupled as possible. I don't want a giant pile of code that every other
project needs to be based on, but I would like a toolbox that can help when
needed.
